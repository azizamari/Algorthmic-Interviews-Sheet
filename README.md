# Algorthms-solutions
I created this repo to save solutions of some problems I solved during my road to master technical interviews

### roadmap:
* Dynamic programming - current
* Trees (and all related stuff) - postponed
* Backtracking
* Greedy Algorithms
* Graph Theory
* Bit manipulation
* ~200 medium leet code problems (quality > quality)

### Resources 
* youtube playlists (will put links soon)
* Cracking the coding interview - Book
* Introduction to algorthms by cormen and more - Book
* Leetcode 
* [Algorthmic-Interviews-Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sIs4MW4JijrxjeW-WQtLj-HV9znTfVjH3a5coSkf5QE)
