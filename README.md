# Algorthms-solutions
I created this repo to save solutions of some problems I solved during my road to master technical interviews

### roadmap:
* Dynamic programming - current
* Trees (and all related stuff) - postponed
* Backtracking
* Greedy Algorithms
* Graph Theory
* Bit manipulation
* ~200 medium leet code problems (quality > quality)
